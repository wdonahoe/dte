                    <p>Being a member means being an active participant in the vibrant, democratic community of the Down to Earth Food Co-op. DTE does not support any form of hierarchy. All members are equally valued and important to the functioning and existence of this cooperative. The members ARE the Down to Earth Food Co-op.</p>

                    <p>To be considered a member, you must pay a membership fee and commit to about 15 hours of time per semester. This time commitment can be fulfilled by various activities: volunteering at local farms, cooking and prep for dinners, or cleaning up after dinners.</p>

                    <p>As a member of the co-op, you can attend as many or as few dinners per semester as you want. We plan to have dinners on 2 different days of the week to accomodate our members' schedules.</p>

                    <p>There are other benefits to membership as well - we plan to hold exciting events, such as field trips, conferences, retreats, guest speakers and much more!</p>

                    <p>You can attend the open dinners on Sundays. These will only be every other Sunday (about 5 per semester). All we ask is for a suggested donation of $5 for non-members. Check the calendar for dates!</p>

                    <p><strong> Why are you not a Registered Student Organization (RSO) at University of Delaware?</strong></p>
                    <p>The focus of Down to Earth Food Coop is to make healthy, earth conscious food accessible to students. Unfortunately when a group becomes an RSO on campus, there are a lot of hoops to jump through when it comes to food, the biggest one being that all food must come from the campus dining service, or Aramark.  The food Aramark purchases is neither organic, local or earth conscious, thus clashing with the mission of DTE. </p><br>
                    <p><strong>Who can join DTE?</strong></p>
                    <p> Down to Earth was made by students, for students, but our definition of a "student" is very broad.  We consider anyone hungry to learn, weather they attend an educational institution or not is considered a student. We also host bi-monthly "open dinners" that anyone (including non-students, and non-members) are invited to!​</p><br>
                    <p><strong>How can I join!?</strong></p>
                    <p>Our membership opens at the beginning of each semester.  Currently we only have the ability to accommodate 80 members.  If you're interested, please contact us (downtoearthfoodcoop@gmail.com)! There is a short form to fill out and a small fee (on a sliding scale based on ability) to pay.</p><br>
                    <p><strong>I can't become a member, but I want to help!</strong></p>
                    <p>Thank you!  We need all the community support we can get!  If you have used kitchen appliances, utensils, serving dishes etc. and would be willing to donate them, we'd be very appreciative! We do ask that donations be used so that we can stick to our mission of being earth conscious! Reduce and Reuse! We also are grateful for any monetary donations which will be put towards finding a permanent location.​</p>
                    <p>DTE is also always looking for community members to share their knowledge with us! If you'd be willing to be a guest speaker at one of our events please contact downtoearthfoodcoop@gmail.com!</p>
                    <p>Everyone is always invited to our community dinners, members and non-members alike. All we ask for is a small donation to help cover the costs of food and chair rentals. Check our facebook page for event updates.</p><br>
                    <p><strong>Do you cater?</strong></p>
                    <p> Give us a call, we'll see if we can accommodate your event depending on the size!</p><br>
